Here is a list of functionalities of this program, together with the publications that should be cited when you use them.

- Construction of simple principally polarized abelian varieties with CM by a given field K (see [1],[2]),
- Functions to verify if the principally polarized abelian variety is a hyperelliptic Jacobian and an reconstruction of its hyperelliptic equation via the computation of the Rosenhain invariants (see [2]),
- Whenever K is a Galois sextic field containing the third roots of unity, the reconstruction of the curve whose Jacobian is the obtained abelian variety, i.e. a Picard curve y^3 = f(x), with deg f = 4 (see [1],[3]).
